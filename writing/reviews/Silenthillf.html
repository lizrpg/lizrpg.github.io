<h1>Fox Boyfriend Blues</h1>
<h2>A Silent Hill f Review by LizRPG</h2>

<div class="essayimgcontainer">

</div>


<p>Here are two things to know about me: One is that I had some horror games on my Steam wishlist for a really long time, but hadn’t actually played a horror game since Resident Evil 4 in 2005. “I like horror stories and being scared,” I thought to myself, “so I must like horror video games, too.” The second thing to know is that my very favorite piece of media of all time is Higurashi When They Cry by Ryukishi07. So, I knew I had to play the Silent Hill game written by Ryukishi07, my favorite writer. Bias disclosed.</p>

<p>And so after forty or so harrowing hours, I got the true ending of Silent Hill f and promptly removed all of the horror games from my Steam Wishlist.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I adored the game– I simply do not have the grit to be scared for forty hours. My blood pressure can’t take it. To make matters worse, someone scoffed on reddit that Silent Hill f “isn’t even scary” especially compared to other horror games. If there is any truth to that, I have no hope of playing any of those games, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>While I don’t know this for a fact, I imagine some of the scary tricks it pulls are rote for the genre, but they all work on me, because I don’t play these games. When an ayakakashi sneaks up on you in the field, you can hear its footsteps, but each time you turn the camera around the monster is frozen… a little bit closer. In subsequent playthroughs, I sort of remembered the places where Kashimashi jumped out from behind corners, but not enough to be confident.</p>

<p>My “I’m-just-here-for-the-story-lookin-ass” put the combat and puzzles on easy. I don’t really play triple-A action games, and I find puzzles to be frustrating. My impatience meter fills up too fast, so don’t look to me for any insightful commentary about the actual gameplay. Regardless, I enjoyed hitting stuff with a pipe (and a sledgehammer!), and my greatest gaming accomplishment might be no-scoping the fox mural puzzle, first try, on all three playthroughs.</p>

<p>The game is an abstract story about a high school girl dealing with a difficult family situation and expectations of marriage and motherhood in a small village in 1960s Japan. About half of it takes place in the village that has been overrun by monsters, and the other half takes place at an interminable shrine, also overrun by monsters.</p>

<p>I’m not going to do a story explainer or anything like that. If you are familiar with Ryukishi07’s oeuvre, you’ll know that he explores familiar themes and topics in Silent Hill f. The gang’s all here: local deities, tension between modern medicine and rural folk beliefs, killing your friends (metaphorically, in this case), post game text summarizing ensuing tragedy, etc. In the case of Hinako, she is exploring her identity in relation to herself and the people in her life, in a world that demands her submission.</p>

<p>(As an aside, it makes me fucking insane that there was minor controversy around this game being “woke.” This has the most softball feminist themes of all time! I kept waiting for some kind of radical other shoe to drop, and it never did. “Sexism in the past was bad” is apparently controversial now.)</p>

<p>There is a kind of video game story twist that is so cheesy and sort of stupid, but it delights me. All of us video-game-knowers understand that some conventional game mechanics need to be wrapped up in some kind of in-universe object or idea, and we’ve played enough video games to suspend our disbelief for all sorts of nonsense. So when your best friend gives you some painkillers that restore your HP at the beginning of the game, you might be like, “Yeah, yeah. Health potion. Got it.” Not so!</p>

<p>…so, that’s the gimmick of the first ending. Subsequent endings are even better. It’s a double edged sword though, because the only thing that bothers me is that you have to play the game three times to finish the story. For the first half of the second playthrough, I was pretty excited by all of the little differences. But by the third playthrough, it felt like I was just speedrunning beating monsters to death with a pipe to get to cutscenes that were mostly the same.</p>

<p>It’s sort of funny, because I think Higurashi’s biggest weakness is its pacing. It’s a time loop story, so there is some repetition. And here we are, playing Silent Hill f, and having the exact same problem.</p>

<p>The other thing I can’t figure out is how on earth you are supposed to get all three endings in three playthroughs without looking up the conditions. I know the game gives you some clues, but I was very careful to follow a guide so that I didn’t accidentally opt myself into a fourth (or fifth!) new game plus.</p>

<p>Anyway, those are my thoughts. I am much more of a Higurashi-enjoyer than Umineko, so I’m sure there is a lot of commentary to be had comparing the two that I didn’t touch on. Overall, I loved the game, and am so glad I played it. The only way I am going to play a triple-A horror game again is if they let Ryukishi07 write another one.</p>
