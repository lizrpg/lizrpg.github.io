<h1>Outer Worlds? More Like Centrist Worlds</h1>
<h2>An Outer Worlds Review by LizRPG</h2>

<p>You can buy a violin on amazon for like $45, but it’s not really a violin. The wood will be garbage, the bridge will be misshapen (if it is even present), and the strings will break. In short, it is not a viable instrument. The violinist subreddit calls them “violin shaped objects” or VSOs.</p>

<p>… Now, I’m not saying that Outer Worlds is unplayable, but while I was working my way through it I kept thinking, “This is not a video game. This is a Video Game Shaped Object.”</p>

<p>The shooting is fine, I guess? I don’t know, I don’t really play games with shooting very often. The combat encounters felt like eating popcorn– kind of bland, all the same, and you just want to keep eating handful after handful. I don’t have an explanation as to why it felt so addictive to me because the game (on normal) is so absurdly easy that you never need to vary your approach– there’s essentially no risk of failure and the skill tree choices you make don’t matter. I mowed down all the marauders(?) in my way until I reached the final boss, died three times in a row, and said to my husband, “Well, I guess I have to figure out how consumables work.” It turns out that consumables are items that you can equip that will automatically activate when you use your inhaler (health potion). Who knew? While I was at it, I figured I might as well use my companion’s ability for the first and only time. The boss died, then it was the end of the game.</p>

<p>My companions made me feel nothing. They all joined the crew for no real reason, and they spilled their guts immediately as if to say, “We’re doing companion quests now! You know, from Video Games? Remember Mass Effect?” I spent the least amount of time with Felix, so it was jarring when he would corner me to talk about how affecting his time with me had been. Glad I could help, buddy.</p>

<p>I played as much of a “good guy” as you can in a world where the game tries to set you up for no good answers. But the only real doozy comes right at the beginning when you have to decide whether you want to reroute power from a hippie settlement to the corporate town they deserted. Oh, and their leader is growing food using dead bodies… which seems neither here nor there, honestly. It’s less “wow, this decision is very thought provoking” and more “wow, fuck all these people.”</p>

<p>In the interest of making no factions seem like the obvious “good guys,” it does that thing where it takes the faction of revolutionaries, who are obviously correct about everything, and then makes them complete buffoons. I ended up taking them to the marketplace of ideas to sit across from the well-meaning corporate guy who wants to “change things from within.” Good news: I’ve united the left!</p>

<p>There’s a big evil plot that’s being perpetrated by The Board, so I went and shot the Big Board Guy and then woke up all of the smart people to save the colony from an impending crisis.</p>

<p>Video Game Complete.</p>

<p>Like the $45 Amazon violin, all the parts are there. You’ve got skill trees, combat, characters, sort of good guys, and sort of bad guys. You can look at it and say, “Yep! That’s a video game,” but it doesn’t make any beautiful music.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>… and with all that said I enjoyed myself just fine. I don’t like doing star ratings, but this is the most 6/10 game ever made. It’s fine.</p>
