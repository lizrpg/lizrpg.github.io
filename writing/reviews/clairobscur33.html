<h1>Let Me Dodge That Real Quick</h1>
<h2>A Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review by LizRPG</h2>

<p>I'm so hot and cold on this game.</p>

<p>Where mechanics are concerned, I had a good time with the combination of menuing and parrying (although, let's be honest, for me it was dodging).<p>

<p>Pictos and lumina are reminiscent of systems I have enjoyed in other games, but in practice they didn't feel very rewarding to play around with. I can look up game breaking damage builds as well as the next person, but there seemed to be very little middle ground between that and playing the game "normally." I would have enjoyed finding little combos and synergies, but they didn't make themselves apparent to me.</p>

<p>Story-wise, I'm flabbergasted that this game got as positive a reception as it did. That's not to say that I thought the story was bad, it's to say that it made me feel bad and I expected public sentiment to reflect that. Obviously, that is not the way things went.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, no matter how thematic and foreshadowed it is, I hate to find out the world and the characters I'm invested in are not “real” in the way that I thought. My interest vanished as soon as I reached the twist.</p>

<p>"But, Liz! This is a story about the very nature of reality. About grief, and being human!" Yeah, yeah, I promise that I get it. But I didn’t like it.</p>

<p>Part of me wonders if I’d like it more if the world outside of the painting had fewer concrete details. “Okay so there’s these painters, okay? And they paint using chroma, but if they are in the paintings for too long they lose their life force oh and one of the painters is on the Painter’s Council so she’s really good at this stuff. Anyway, here’s a sixty minute explainer and a timeline.” … please. These were actually not the mysteries I wanted answers to.</p>

<p>And once again, I really do get it. The world inside the painting is intentionally vague and explains very little, so it follows that the “real world” would feel well-explained by comparison. But I spent all my time in the world of the painting, so it makes no difference to me that god is dead and it’s actually god’s mom that is killing us for reasons we can’t really interact with in a positive way.</p>

<p>Clearly, my emotional reaction (I’m not even going to call it an opinion), was in the minority. I’m happy for everyone that found the game to be emotionally resonant, and that’s not something I can argue with.</p>
